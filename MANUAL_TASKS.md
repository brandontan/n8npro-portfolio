## Email Flow Status: ✅ READY

Your email infrastructure is perfectly configured:

```
Contact Form → EmailJS → brandon@n8npro.com → Cloudflare → Gmail → fetchmail → Poste.io
```

**All components working:**
- ✅ EmailJS credentials configured in Vercel
- ✅ Form sends to `brandon@n8npro.com` 
- ✅ Cloudflare Email Routing active
- ✅ fetchmail pulling from Gmail every 5 minutes
- ✅ Poste.io receiving emails

**Once authentication is disabled, the contact form will work immediately.**
