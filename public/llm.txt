# n8nPro - Brandon Tan's Automation Portfolio

## About the Business

**Business Name:** n8nPro
**Owner:** Brandon Tan
**Specialization:** n8n Automation Specialist
**Tagline:** "I Build Intelligent Automation" - Turning Business Chaos Into Streamlined Workflows

## Professional Background

Brandon Tan is an n8n automation specialist who discovered his expertise through real-world experience. He was originally hired to handle manual lead management tasks - researching prospects, copying data between platforms, crafting personalized emails, and managing multiple systems. After two weeks of 12-hour days doing repetitive tasks, he discovered n8n and automated everything instead of continuing the manual grind.

**Key Achievement:** What used to take 60+ hours per week now runs automatically. The client's lead generation went from a bottleneck to their biggest growth driver.

**Philosophy:** "I've been in your shoes. I know what it's like to be buried in manual processes, so I build automation that actually solves real problemsâ€”not just impressive demos."
