# Supabase Storage Analysis & Recommendations

## Current Implementation Issues

### 1. Images stored as Base64 in Database
- Images are converted to base64 data URLs
- Stored directly in the `content` field of activities table
- Base64 encoding increases size by ~33%
- All image data counts against DATABASE storage, not file storage

### 2. Videos 
- YouTube videos are stored as embed URLs (good - no storage impact)
- Local video uploads would face same issue as images

## Supabase Free Tier Limits

### Database Storage
- **Free tier**: 500 MB
- Base64 images in database will consume this VERY quickly
- Example: A 1MB image becomes 1.33MB in base64

### File Storage (Supabase Storage)
- **Free tier**: 1 GB
- This is separate from database storage
- Should be used for images/videos instead

### Bandwidth
- **Free tier**: 2 GB/month
- Each time someone views a post, images are downloaded

## Storage Consumption Estimate

With current implementation:
- 10 blog posts with 3 images each (avg 500KB/image)
- = 30 images × 500KB × 1.33 (base64) = ~20MB
- Just 25 such posts would exceed 500MB database limit!

## Recommended Solution

### 1. Use Supabase Storage for Images
Instead of base64, upload images to Supabase Storage buckets:
- Create a public bucket for blog images
- Upload images get a public URL
- Store only the URL in database
- Images don't count against database storage

### 2. Image Optimization
- Resize images before upload (max 1920px width)
- Convert to WebP format (50-80% smaller)
- Use quality compression (85% quality usually imperceptible)

### 3. Alternative: External Image Hosting
For maximum savings:
- Cloudinary (free tier: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month)
- ImageKit (free tier: 20GB bandwidth/month)
- Uploadcare (free tier: 3GB storage, 30GB bandwidth)

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Stop using base64 for images
2. **Next**: Implement Supabase Storage upload
3. **Optional**: Add image optimization
4. **Consider**: External CDN for heavy usage

## Current Risk Level: HIGH
- Each blog post with images rapidly consumes database storage
- You could hit limits with just 20-30 image-heavy posts
- Database storage is harder to clean up than file storage
